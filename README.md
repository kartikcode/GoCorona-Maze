# GoCorona-Maze
Maze game developed using Javascript with additional features.<br>
Idea originally inspired from Pickle Rick Maze game( just Google it). However, 'cause COVID-19 is trending these days,<br>
I'm planning to add the following functionalities to it:<br>
- Additionaly add the Mode feature in which Classic would be similar to the original one.
- Madness would be something similar to what was there in the final task of Goblet of Fire( okay, somewhat similar).<br> The maze would keep on refreshing after a certain duration of time.
- On the other side of the maze, display live stats of COVID-19 across different nations scraped through W.H.O.'s official page.
